									<h2>Reflections on career aspirations</h2>
									<p>In the future, I see myself working at the heart of the transportation industry, working with innovative technology, specifically artificial intelligence in transport. I’m drawn to companies like Tesla, Airbus and Safran or innovative startups that have a main focus on new technology and sustainability. Location-wise, I would like the ability to be flexible and work away from an office, but I would also want those days where I can come and work in the office; Ideally, a balance between the two would be nice. For me, what matters the most is working in a team and being part of one. Working with people that value creativity and have innovative minds towards tech and problem solving will help me grow and gain more experience in that kind of environment.</p>
									<p>I researched Job a general Job description on Indeed and LinkedIn, and I've learned that there are many important requirements needed for this job.</p>
									<p>•	Technical skills: Having strong knowledge of programming languages, specifically C++, Python, Java and MATLAB, is required for this Job. I’ll also need some experience with frameworks such as ROS and TensorFlow. Moreover, being familiar with development tools and practices such as debugging and testing is a must.</p>
									<p>•	Industry knowledge: I need to be familiar with what is standard in the industry. For example, if I want to be an autonomous vehicle software engineer for cars, I need to understand automotive safety standards. I also need to know trends such as how EV battery management is changing. A guest speaker from a company called Ovarro told us how important it is to know the industry, especially the company you’re shooting for.</p>
									<p>•	Team work: In any engineering-oriented job, collaboration is key. I’ll need to sharpen my communication skills a bit more to work cross-functionally with other members on the team. For example, I will need to team up with the designers to assess if a concept is actually possible or talk to the project manager and explain complicated technology simply.</p>
									<p>•	Qualifications: A guest speaker from BCS  explained how my degree lays the foundations and groundwork and that I need to put more on my qualification list to stand out, such as experience. BCS is a great tool to not only find what you want to do within the IT space, but what kind of qualifications you would need. For me an internship based around machine learning would be beneficial.</p>
