									<h2>Important characteristics for professional behaviour as a student</h2>
									<p>As a student, professional behaviour is very important. Copying work is prohibited, such as a classmate’s assignment or work online, as it is copyright. Listening to peers and taking on their ideas is a professional trait to have. Respectfully handling data and ethical use of tools is a professional characteristic as you may be in a situation where you have to abide by NTU data protection GDPR policies or you may have to use AI in an ethical manner.</p>
									<h2>How being unprofessional impacts others</h2>
									<p>•	It can break trust with peers or NTU. For example cheating and being discovered.</p>
									<p>•	Sharing project data with students a year lower to help them could breach NTU data management guidelines depending on the project rules.</p>
									<p>•	Using discriminatory language in class or online could harm NTU’s image and my future employability. It is important to talk and behave professionally in and outside work/education.</p>
									<h2>Professional behaviours that may be relevant in my future career</h2>
									<p>•	Developing AI systems requires me to handle data with care and stay up to date with data rules and regulations.</p>
									<p>•	Be ethical and avoid using biased sources and copyrighting.</p>
									<p>•	Having safety as a natural concern is a good characteristic as It is important to make sure the code has been thoroughly tested, especially when you’re dealing with autonomous systems.</p>
									<h2>Professional skills I need to develop</h2>
									<p>•	I need to develop better sustainability practices. Making code more efficient lowers energy costs and helps the company meet legal energy regulation limits.</p>
									<p>•	If I see something unethical from my peers at NTU or at work, speak up immediately. This is important as most tech companies handle personal data and when developing AI it needs to be developed in an ethical manner.</p>
									<p>Being professional is a must, especially in the industry I am aiming to be in. It isn’t just a rule, I believe it’s about making tech safe, being ethical, improving your reputation and most importantly, personal growth.</p>
