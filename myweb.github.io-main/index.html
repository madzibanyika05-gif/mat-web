										</header>
										<p>This is the start to my portfolio, here I share a bit about myself, from my career aspirations to knowledge and skills I have learnt throughout the years. I have always wanted to design software and learn how it works, and on this site, which I have programmed, I’m also going to talk about the Job I’m going for and why.  </p>
										<p>I have always been interested in how software can work in harmony with hardware and work together to create something innovative. I went for a work experience at SPE energy Wales, which taught me more about the hardware side of things, creating circuits, and learning about grid transformers. I went on a second work experience to Heathrow airport to learn about plane systems and why margin of error is so important, they talked about all kinds of engineering paths to go down, software engineering interested me the most because I found the autopilot system so interesting. I’ve learnt technical skills from creating Python projects and C++ projects for my degree. I want to get into app building in my free time, so I can learn some more programming tools, I've been trying to learn Swift on Mac, and I would like to create a Bible study app. I’m a tech enthusiast who loves to nerd out about mobile phone specs, laptop specs, and consumer electronic hardware in general. I have also been interested in the automotive world as well, and I would consider myself a car enthusiast too. As cars have become more technologically advanced, I have gained a huge interest in electric cars, especially their self-driving software. The job role of an autonomous vehicle software engineer really interests me, whether that’s cars, planes or trucks; I am also very interested in the AI side of things within the transportation industry. </p>
